            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b>  2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist

              who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom

              across the  world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family  in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula 

         and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief 

        minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.

        Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.
